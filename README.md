## 🧠 Building a Customer Intent Classifier with NLP

In this project, we’ll create a **customer intent classifier** using natural language processing (NLP) techniques with **TensorFlow**. The model will help categorize customer queries or messages by identifying the intent behind them. Let’s dive into the world of customer support automation! 📞💬

## Project Overview

**Intent classification** is a key technique in customer support, helping businesses quickly understand and respond to customer needs. In this project, we’ll train an NLP model that can automatically categorize customer queries based on their intent. This will allow businesses to prioritize high-severity issues and address potential risks to customer satisfaction.

We’ll use a dataset of **13,083 customer service queries**, each labeled with one of **77 intents** in a banking context. The model will learn to classify these queries into different severity levels, helping business owners quickly identify urgent cases and take action.

### Key Features:

- 🧠 **Intent Classification**: Train an NLP model to classify customer service queries into 77 intents.
- 🏷️ **Severity Categorization**: Automate the classification of queries based on severity levels (e.g., high, medium, low).
- 🧹 **Text Preprocessing**: Prepare a text preprocessing pipeline to clean and tokenize the data.
- 📊 **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset using Python libraries like **pandas** and **seaborn** to visualize trends and patterns.
  
## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation and model building.
- **TensorFlow**: For training the deep learning model.
- **Pandas**: To manage and process the data.
- **seaborn**: For visualizing the dataset and model results.

## 🤖 Skills Applied

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Machine Learning for Text Classification
- Deep Learning with TensorFlow

## Example Tasks You Can Do

- **Classify Customer Intent**: Use the model to automatically detect the intent behind customer queries.
- **Categorize Severity**: Automatically classify the severity of customer issues to prioritize urgent cases.
- **Visualize Data**: Explore the dataset and visualize trends in customer queries using seaborn.
